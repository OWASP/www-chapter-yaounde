## OWASP Yaounde Chapter Goals
Welcome to the Yaounde chapter homepage.

Cameroon is a diverse country located in Central Africa. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of information security, particularly from local professionals who have been eager to build a community and foster progress. Furthermore, higher learning institutions in Cameroon are now actively incorporating cybersecurity education into their curricula, producing a new generation of security professionals. The OWASP-Yaounde chapter seeks to contribute to raising awareness about software security issues in Cameroon by leveraging the resources and activities offered by the OWASP foundation.

Specifically, the wealth of knowledge and resources available through the global OWASP community presents a valuable opportunity for Cameroonian authorities, professionals, and recent graduates in terms of training, best practices, and networking. Our primary mission is to utilize these resources to foster a strong cybersecurity awareness within Yaounde and throughout Cameroon. Do check out our sibling chapter [OWASP Buea](/www-chapter-buea/).
